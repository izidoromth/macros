### :pencil: About the project

I began this initiative after my own journey of losing fat and getting in a more healthy lifestyle. It is aligned with the IIFYM diet, a sort of diet where you can actually eat anything you want, without extreme low-carb strategies or food restriction that makes you hate dieting. Furthermore, this projects let me demonstrate my skills in system design, programming and technology.
